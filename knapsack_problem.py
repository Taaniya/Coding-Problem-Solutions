"""
Problem statement- 
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. 
i.e., given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items 
respectively.You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

  """
  Solution for 0/1 Knapsack problem implemented using Dynamic Programming with tabulation.
  A row & column of zeros in the beginning to set up default values in the dp array.
  
  Time and space complexity - O(n * w)
  Reference - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRza99HPvkQ   

  Parameters:
  -------------
  items : List(int), list of integers representing items
  weights : List(int), list of weights corresponding to each item
  w : (int) weight capacity of knapsack
  
  Returns:
  -------------
  maximum : (int), Maximum value of subset of items with total weight <= weight capacity.
  eg.
    >> findMaxSet([5,7, 2,3],[6,8,2,4],15)
    >> 12
    >>
    >> findMaxSet([1, 2, 5, 6],[2, 3, 4, 5],8)
    >> 8
